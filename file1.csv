0,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","How does something become acidic? In this video you will learn what are acids, and what is that strange pH scale."
1,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Acids are substances that have a sour taste, such as citric acid, which is in lemons, and vinegar, which is called sour wine in French. There are many other natural acids as well, such as the lactic acid in sour milk and the poisonous oxalic acid present in the revelry plant."
2,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Two hundred and fifty years ago, early chemists discovered that non-metals form acids on burning. That's why he named the gas present in the air as oxygen, which means 'acid maker'. The burning of sulfur i.e. sulfur produces sulfur dioxide gas, which dissolves in water to form sulfurous acid."
3,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Carbonic acid is formed from carbon dioxide, which makes rain water always mildly acidic. Nitrogen dioxide dissolves in water to form nitric acid. But oxygen combines with reactive metals to form alkalis."
4,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","In this way, oxygen forms not only acids but also bases. In water, acids attach a hydrogen ion, or proton, to the water atom, forming the hydronium ion H3O+. For example, hydrochloric acid forms chloride ions and hydronium ions."
5,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Acetate ion from acetic acid. Sulfate ion from sulfuric acid. The amount of acidity can be measured on the pH scale. Which measures the concentration of hydronium or hydrogen ion. The small p is the power, and the capital H is the hydrogen ion."
6,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Acids can change the color of the indicators. Try making your own pointer, from red cabbage leaves, or the sap of colorful plants. Add lemon juice and then lime, and watch as the color gradually changes from green to blue as the acid neutralizes."
7,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","The most famous indicator is litmus, which is extracted from lichens, ie algae. Indicators turn red when exposed to acidic solutions, and blue in alkaline. Indicators indicating the acidity of different substances are made by mixing different colors i.e. dyes. The amount of acidity is measured on the pH scale - the pH of the strongest acid is assumed to be zero. Meaning the lower the pH, the more powerful the acid. As the pH increases, the acidity decreases. Any neutral solution has a pH of 7 and above that, the solution is considered alkaline. The pH of the strongest base is 14."
8,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","The pH scale is logarithmic. Meaning that a change of 1 point in pH represents a 10-fold change in acidity. See this example to understand its logarithmic property. You've collected a bucket of acid rain water with a pH of 4, and you want to lower its acidity to add it to the garden."
9,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","To change the pH from 4 to 5, how much neutral water do you have to add? Stop the video and think."
10,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","The answer is, it would take 9 buckets of neutral water to change the pH by just 1 point, because a 1 point change in pH represents a tenfold change in acidity."
11,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Simply put, most acids are naturally present, which dissolve in water and have a sour taste. Warning! Taste only foods. Acids also form when oxides of nonmetals, such as sulfur dioxide, dissolve in water."
12,"What Makes Something Acidic? | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Many types of indicators are found, which help us to find out the acidity of a substance. And the strength of acidity is measured in the pH scale, which is logarithmic."
13,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In this video we will learn about the two major layers of our atmosphere - the troposphere, which contains weather fluctuations and 'bad' ozone, and the stratosphere, whose 'good' ozone gives us the dangerous ultraviolet rays. protects from."
14,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Our atmosphere is made up of gases - mainly nitrogen and oxygen. These gases are bound to the earth due to gravity, like an ocean of air. Because air is compressible, that is, it can be compressed, so the air becomes less dense as it moves away from the ground. It is believed that 99% of our atmosphere is within the first 50 kilometers."
15,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"The visible light of the sun, passing through the atmosphere, heats the ground. This heats the air near the ground. As the cooler air above comes down, it expands and pushes the warmer air upwards. This movement of air, called the convention currents, gives rise to the weather system."
16,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"After going up to 10 km, the atmosphere continues to cool - the temperature is lowest at the tropopause. Below this lies the troposphere, which comprises 80% of the atmosphere and the weather zone."
17,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Above the troposphere is the stratosphere. It is a thin layer of air that is heated from above. This is because good ozone absorbs ultraviolet rays, which keep it warm from above. This layer cools from below, due to which it remains in a dynamically stable state in terms of motion."
18,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Compare this with the ever-changing troposphere. If you have traveled by plane, then after taking off, it starts hiccups in the troposphere. But after going above the clouds, it flies freely across the weather zone."
19,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,Fan ships cannot fly that high because the air here is not dense enough to push the fan. So where does this good ozone of the stratosphere come from? Pay attention to the chemical formula of ozone by stopping the video.
20,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,Ozone is an allotrope of oxygen. Its molecules are made up of three oxygen atoms bonded together by weak bonds. Ozone is a volatile gas that slowly breaks down into oxygen molecules.
21,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In the ozone-oxygen cycle, ultraviolet rays continually build and break down stratospheric ozone. First, oxygen molecules in the stratosphere absorb ultraviolet rays, which break up into two fast-moving atoms."
22,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,These fast-moving oxygen atoms collide with the molecules of the air around them (nitrogen and oxygen). This causes the free moving atoms of oxygen to slow down so that they bind to weak bonds with the oxygen molecule to form ozone gas.
23,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"If they're running too fast, they collide and splash away! The energy they give to the air molecules heats the upper part of the atmosphere. Now the oxygen atom has joined with the oxygen molecule to form ozone."
24,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Ozone absorbs ultraviolet rays very well, due to which ozone decomposes back into oxygen atoms and oxygen molecules and the upper part of the atmosphere remains warm. When the oxygen atom slows down, ozone is formed again."
25,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Ozone extends throughout the stratosphere, shown here in black. Why do you think ozone is so low at the top and bottom? Recall that ultraviolet rays and oxygen are needed to make ozone. Pause the video and think."
26,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"There is very little oxygen here. And here near the troposphere where the temperature is lowest, the troposphere and stratosphere meet, there is no ultraviolet rays at this place. The ozone above has absorbed all the ultraviolet rays."
27,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"So this is the ozone layer. If all the ozone were to be suppressed as a solid, its thickness would be the same as that of a sheet of cardboard. But in reality it is a gas which is spread over 20 to 30 kilometers."
28,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When there was no oxygen in our atmosphere, then ultraviolet rays reached the ground and did not allow life to flourish on the ground."
29,The Ozone Layer - Part 1 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Ozone is also present in the troposphere, which is mainly formed due to sunlight falling on the pollution of vehicles. This results in the formation of photochemical smog, which is a chemical smog caused by light and is a pollutant."
30,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,In this video you will learn about the famous hole in the ozone layer and also why the ozone layer has become thinner. We will see what steps the world has taken to correct its situation. Watch Part 1 of this video to learn how stratospheric ozone is formed and how it prevents harmful ultraviolet rays from reaching the ground.
31,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In the 1980s, scientists discovered something disturbing over Antarctica. This phenomenon was seen in October when sunlight returned to the South Pole. Ozone had disappeared from a very large area, due to which a famous hole was formed in its layer."
32,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"An airplane that analyzed the composition of the air flew into the stratosphere 15 kilometers above the South Pole, where the most ozone is found. It was discovered that ozone has suddenly been replaced by chlorine oxide."
33,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"After this incident, it was found that chemicals named CFCs - chloro fluorocarbons - are responsible for this. These are inert and stable molecules. They were once thought to be miraculous chemicals used in refrigerators and air conditioners, as a liquid for expanding polystyrene, and for spraying hair sprays and paints."
34,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,They did not harm the animals. So where's the mess?
35,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,CFCs are so inactive that they are not washed away by rain or dissipated in the troposphere. Therefore they gradually reach the top of the stratosphere. Use your knowledge of ozone formation to imagine what would have happened to CFCs in the stratosphere. Stop the video and think.
36,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Here many ultraviolet rays fall on them, due to which the chlorine atom gets separated from the molecule. They then bind to oxygen atoms, preventing them from forming ozone in the ozone-oxygen cycle, as we saw in the first part of the video."
37,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When chlorine oxide combines with another oxygen atom, it becomes an oxygen molecule again, and the chlorine atom continues to separate more oxygen atoms. These chlorine atoms eventually naturally withdraw from the stratosphere, but before this can happen they prevent the thousands of ozone-forming oxygen atoms from forming ozone."
38,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,In this way the ozone-oxygen cycle was being broken and the ozone layer was getting thinner all over the world.
39,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Therefore, in 1987, all the countries of the world signed the Montreal Protocol and banned the production of CFCs and finally their use."
40,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"HFCs—Hydro Fluoro Carbon—are now used in their place. It contains hydrogen atoms instead of chlorine, making it slightly more reactive so that it decomposes in the troposphere before reaching the ozone layer."
41,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Since chlorine is naturally removed from the stratosphere by complex photochemical reactions, and ozone is naturally formed continuously by oxygen and ultraviolet rays, it is expected that ozone will return to its old level within 50–100 years. Will come"
42,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Through holes in the ozone layer, harmful ultraviolet rays reach the ground, which can cause skin cancer. Although there is a wrong concept, that heat comes in from the hole, which leads to global warming, but this is not correct."
43,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Ozone is also formed in the troposphere due to complex photo-chemical reactions on the smoke coming out of vehicles. Here in the troposphere, ozone acts as a greenhouse gas and also helps in the formation of photochemical smog, which pollutes cities around the world from time to time."
44,What Is The Hole In The Ozone - Part 2 | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"For example, Los Angeles of America and Beijing of China."
45,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,In this video we will learn about natural greenhouse effect. We will see how our atmosphere keeps our planet warm by preventing the return of energy from the sun.
46,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In the second part of this video, it will be told that how man is changing the climate by changing the atmosphere."
47,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In this section we will see, what was the natural state of the atmosphere before the intervention of humans. If you inflate a football, will it become lighter? The answer is that the weight of the football will increase slightly."
48,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"This is because the gases like oxygen and nitrogen present in the air are made of atoms, which have mass, and they are attracted towards the earth due to gravity. So as you keep adding more molecules, you keep increasing the weight."
49,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In fact, due to gravity, our atmosphere is bound to the Earth. It is like an ocean, an ocean of air. The only difference is that it is much more dispersed than water, and as it moves away from the earth, it expands further."
50,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Gases are heavy, but not very heavy, and they are made of real matter. Now let's look at the energy we get from the sun. You must know something about the electromagnetic spectrum – rays of energy that travel at the speed of light."
51,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Here is the entire spectrum - zero energy in the beginning, the least harmful radio waves and finally the more harmful rays - ultraviolet, x-rays and gamma rays."
52,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Most of the energy that comes from the sun comes in the form of visible light. Most of the little ultraviolet rays that come in are blocked by the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. You can also watch a video on this. However, even then, such a part of them reaches the ground, that if left in the sun for a long time, the skin will be damaged. Only a small part of solar energy is found in the form of infrared, that is, infrared or heat radiation."
53,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Visible light passes directly through our transparent atmosphere. By absorbing some of this light, the earth heats up. Hot objects give off infrared rays. Without touching your cheek, bring your palm very close to the cheek. Did you feel hot? This is infrared radiation."
54,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Infrared cameras can detect this radiation emanating from hot objects. Now the thing to note. Visible light can easily pass through the atmosphere, but infrared radiation from Earth has great difficulty passing through. The same thing happens in a greenhouse or car standing in the sun."
55,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Visible light travels through the glass, heating the soil or car seats, which give off infrared heat radiation. But this radiation cannot pass through the glass. Hence the heat increases inside the greenhouse and the car."
56,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"So the atmosphere acts somewhat like a glass. It allows visible light to pass through and heats the Earth, but blocks the heat (or infrared radiation) from the Earth. This retained heat is absorbed by some of the gases in the atmosphere. These gases are called greenhouse gases."
57,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In this way the earth remains warm, and it is called the natural greenhouse effect. The two main gases that absorb infrared radiation are water vapor and carbon dioxide. If you live in a colder area, you will know that in winter the clouds made of water droplets cover the night sky and do not let the heat out, thus preventing frost in the morning."
58,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"But if there are no clouds, then the heat goes out from the open sky and frost is formed."
59,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Before industrialization based on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 0.028%; This is much less than 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen, but enough to keep us warm."
60,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Without this natural blanket of cover, the Earth would have been too cold for life to flourish."
61,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In summary, we have seen that the atmosphere is made up of gases. These gases are bound to the earth due to gravity. The sun's rays pass through the atmosphere and heat the earth, but some of the heat radiation that is produced after that is absorbed by greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide."
62,What Is The Natural Greenhouse Effect? | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"This is good, and keeps the earth warm enough for life to survive. In the next video, we will see how burning fossil fuels increases carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and how it is causing global warming and climate change."
63,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In this video you will learn that by burning fossil fuels, rain can become acidic in two very different ways. Burning coal and oil releases sulfuric acid, especially in power stations, while nitric acid is released from the smoke of our vehicles."
64,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,You will also learn about some of the effects of acid rain on the environment.
65,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"First it is important to know that rain is naturally acidic. When falling from the sky, rain absorbs the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere to form carbonic acid. It is a weak acid, due to which the pH of rain becomes 6."
66,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When we burn fossil fuels, the strong acids dissolve in the rain, which can reduce the pH of the rain to 3."
67,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When the pH goes from 6 to 3, how many times do you think the acidity will increase? 2 times, 3 times, 10 times, thousand times? Stop the video and think."
68,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Remember, a one-digit change in pH means a 10-fold change in acidity. So the pH being 6 to 3 is ten x ten x ten, that is, a thousand times more acidity."
69,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"We will first look at sulfuric acid. Plants need a little sulfur to grow. They get it from sulfates, such as potassium sulfate naturally present in the soil. Plant roots take up sulfates, and in leaf proteins, sulfur atoms attach to carbon atoms."
70,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Millions of years after the plant has died, it eventually becomes coal. Even then the sulfur atoms remain bonded to the carbon atoms. The amount of sulfur in coal and oil is about 1% to 4% by weight."
71,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,What do you think is formed when fossil fuels containing sulfur are burned? Stop the video and think.
72,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When coal burns, the sulfur and carbon atoms combine with the oxygen present in the air and go into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide."
73,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Sunlight triggers a chemical reaction. In this, sulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. It dissolves in rain water to form sulfuric acid."
74,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Now let us see how nitric acid reaches in the rain. In the high temperature of the cylinders of our vehicles, small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen in the air can interact."
75,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Remember, the air inhaled to burn the fuel is 80% nitrogen. That's why vehicle smoke contains small, but effective, amounts of nitrogen oxides."
76,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Once nitrogen oxides are released into the air, they react with oxygen in the same way as we saw in sulfur dioxide. Then they dissolve in rain water to form nitric acid."
77,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"If this rain falls on alkaline soils with limestone, neutralization of acidity can occur. But if the same rain falls on neutral or acidic soil or vegetation, it can cause damage."
78,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,So why is this acidity harmful to living beings? Living beings do not develop properly in acidic conditions and this is easy to show. Dip one piece of bread in vinegar and the other in pure water. Leave them open for a while and then keep them covered for a week.
79,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"You will find that the mold has not grown on the bread dipped in vinegar, while it has grown on the other bread. Actually, we use vinegar to preserve pickles, that is, to prevent spoilage. This is because some enzymes needed for growth are unable to function under acidic conditions."
80,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"The second main problem is in the soil. However, naturally occurring toxic metals, such as aluminum, do not dissolve in water and therefore do not harm neutral soils. But in acidic soil, they dissolve and reach inside living beings. They replace essential metals like zinc and iron in the body of animals."
81,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In addition, the hydrogen ions present in acid rain replace essential metal ions such as potassium, magnesium and calcium, which are often bound to clay. Due to this the essential metal ions are washed away deep into the soil and carried away from the roots of the plants."
82,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Overall, ordinary rain is slightly acidic due to dissolved carbon dioxide, but acid rain contains sulfuric acid and nitric acid, making it a thousand times more acidic, and harmful to many living beings."
83,Acid rain | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,Sulfuric acid is produced by burning fossil fuels containing sulfur. Nitric acid is produced by the burning of nitrogen and oxygen in the cylinders of petrol and diesel engines at high temperatures.
84,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Water Pollution. In this video we will know that all kinds of substances thrown by humans have polluted the lakes, rivers and seas."
85,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"The United Nations estimates that about 10% of the world's people do not have access to clean drinking water. That is, more than 70 crore people. The main problem with this dirty water is that it carries diseases like cholera, spread by untreated human sewage."
86,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,The problem is more severe in slums and refugee camps near major cities. Disease-laden water from poorly managed garbage dumps can also pollute rivers and small streams.
87,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,But not only human excreta pollutes water sources. Most of the substances released by humans into rivers and oceans are more dangerous to ecosystems than to harm us directly.
88,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Compared to organic manure, chemical fertilizers are more soluble in water. Therefore, due to heavy rains, they can reach rivers and ponds, which leads to eutrophication. Fertilizers cause excessive growth of algae, leaving a carpet-like layer of them on the surface of the pond."
89,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"This layer does not allow sunlight to reach the vegetation present under the water, due to which they die. The bacteria then eat these dead plants, and use up the remaining oxygen. When all the oxygen in the water is exhausted, all aquatic organisms die, and the ecosystem of the pond is destroyed."
90,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"If heavy metals, such as lead, mercury and cadmium, reach rivers and ponds, many organisms will die."
91,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In 1968, in Minamata, Japan, a polluting factory making fungicide from mercury was closed. But the people there are still suffering the loss of mercury. This is called Minamata disease. Because in the fish there, the remains of mercury are still found."
92,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Nowadays, most fungicides use copper and organic substances instead of mercury and cadmium. In the 1970s, it was discovered that the lead that was added to make petrol burn more efficiently, caused mental disorders. After this information, the work of removing lead from petrol was started."
93,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Since then, it has taken 40 years for the United Nations to ban the sale of leaded petrol. The last 6 countries agreed in 2013."
94,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Radioactive waste is often stored above ground, in water tanks, unless it is stored permanently, buried in the ground, for millions of years. The fear remains, that at some point these underground reserves may deteriorate. If this happens, the water sources will get polluted."
95,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"At present, small amounts of radioactive waste are allowed to flow into the ocean, thinking that it will be so dilute that it will not affect the radioactivity naturally present in the ocean."
96,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"After some nuclear accidents, such as Five Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011, water sources and the sea have become dangerously polluted with radioactive waste."
97,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"When digging and drilling to extract minerals from the ground, water from natural underground aquifers can become polluted."
98,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Plastic, dumped in large quantities by ships and carried by land waste dumps into the oceans, is floating around as giant islands of garbage, posing a serious threat to fish, sea birds and other marine organisms ."
99,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is half the size of Europe. There are four more such floating piles of garbage.
100,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"Power stations, powered by coal and oil, have been responsible for acid rain many years ago. These power stations devastated many lakes in northern Europe in the 1960s. Watch our video on Acid Rain to know more on this."
101,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,Fossil fuel and nuclear power stations require steam to power their turbines. A large amount of water is required for the condensation of this steam. This water is often cooled in large towers located at the stations itself.
102,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"However, this water reaching rivers or seas, will be already warm and this can have a bad effect on the ecosystem of the river or sea. Even though it is not a separate substance, its heat is a pollutant."
103,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,"In summary, humans are polluting rivers, lakes, and seas in many ways. Perhaps the most dangerous is human sewage, which is killing or making millions of creatures sick."
104,What Is Water Pollution | Environmental Chemistry | Chemistry | FuseSchool,Watch this video on water treatment to know how we are trying to purify dirty water and make it potable.
105,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"Eutrophication is the process that can take place in a river or lake, when a lot of nutrients come into it. Eutrophication begins when nutrient-rich fertilisers, such as nitrates and phosphates, are carried away by water into a river or lake. This greatly increases the amount of nutrients in the water."
106,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"These nutrients are beneficial for algae. Algae grow and reproduce rapidly, forming a thick green layer on the surface of the water. This algal bloom, that is, a sheet of algae, absorbs the sunlight falling on the surface, so that it does not reach the bottom. As a result, photosynthesizing aquatic plants die in the absence of light."
107,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"When these algae have eaten up all the nutrients, and the food runs out, they also start dying. After this, the bacteria, after eating the dead plants and algae, release nutrients into the water again, and this algae bloom cycle ie algal bloom starts again."
108,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"Due to the continuous supply of food, the bacteria start multiplying in great numbers. To grow and respire, they use oxygen. Water is already depleted of oxygen and when bacteria use it rapidly, it can be completely depleted. Water without oxygen is called anoxic."
109,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"If water is exposed to anoxia, all organisms except bacteria, including fish and other animals, die."
110,What Is Eutrophication | Agriculture | Biology | FuseSchool,"So eutrophication occurs when the nutrients in the water increase. This causes algae to bloom, sunlight does not reach down, and bacteria get plenty of food. The bacteria use up the oxygen of the water, and there is anoxia, which kills all the organisms living in the water.
Nutrition is also a reason, which tells that we should use fertilizers carefully in agriculture."
111,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Our solid earth is covered by a layer of gases, which is called the atmosphere. For every kind of life on earth, we should thank the atmosphere."
112,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Earth is the only planet in our solar system whose atmosphere is conducive to life. Our atmosphere is made up of different molecules, mostly nitrogen. Apart from this, it also contains other molecules in very small quantities, including oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide and water vapour."
113,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"In addition to providing air to breathe, the atmosphere also protects us from the sun's radiation and heat. During the day, the atmosphere protects us from excessive heat, and at night it covers us like a warm blanket, protecting us from the extreme cold."
114,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"It gives us - our weather, oxygen to breathe, water vapor, weather and temperature control. I hope you are realizing how important this blanket of gases is for us."
115,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"The atmosphere is about 100 kilometers thick, and is divided into different layers. It starts from the troposphere, which is closest to the ground and extends up to 14.5 km above. It has the highest density due to gravity. Clouds are formed in the troposphere, and almost all the effects of weather remain here. And almost all the factors affecting the weather are also present here."
116,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"After this, there is the stratosphere, which is up to 50 km, and which has the much needed ozone layer. The ozone layer warms the stratosphere, and absorbs and scatters harmful ultraviolet rays coming from the Sun, ie Ultra Violet Radiations, which keeps all life on Earth safe."
117,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Up to 85 km above it, the mesosphere is the mesosphere. It protects us from the stones coming from space, which are called meteors. When they reach the mesosphere, the friction of the air burns most of those meteors, or at least breaks them into very small pieces."
118,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"After that there is the outer atmosphere ie thermosphere. The International Space Center revolves around the Earth at an altitude of 400 km. Then in the exosphere, our atmosphere mixes with space. Another great thing that the atmosphere does is that it makes it possible for us to hear each other."
119,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"The song of birds, the sound of vehicles while crossing the road."
120,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Sound waves need air to travel through. Because there is no air in space, sound waves cannot travel there, and space is quiet. In movies where spaceships go out of our atmosphere, and they explode, all those sounds are fake. In fact you won't hear anything there."
121,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Apart from the sound, we should also thank the atmosphere for our blue sky. Why do you think the sky is blue, while space is black? Stop the video and think."
122,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"The white light of the Sun falls on the molecules of the atmosphere, causing scattering. Blue light is scattered in every direction, and the sky appears blue. Blue light is scattered the most because it has the shortest wavelength. Therefore, compared to the rest of the waves, the molecules of the atmosphere scatter the most blue."
123,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"There is no atmosphere on the Moon, so from there the sky appears black all the time, because there are no particles that can scatter blue light. That's why the sky always looks black in all the pictures of the Apollo landings."
124,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,So we have seen some reasons why the atmosphere is so important for life on earth. We'll look at the change in atmospheric pressure at the end.
125,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Air pressure is related to the weight of the air above. With increasing altitude, as the distance from the Earth increases, we have air above us, but its amount decreases."
126,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"So with increasing altitude, the air pressure decreases, until we reach the extreme end of the atmosphere. There is absolutely no air, and therefore no pressure."
127,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Most of the molecules in the atmosphere are closer to the Earth due to gravity. Therefore, as altitude increases, the air pressure first decreases rapidly, and gradually decreases at higher altitudes. That's why the air is thinner on the mountains, and climbers often need oxygen to breathe."
128,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,The pressure on Mount Everest is only 30% of the sea level pressure.
129,Earth's Atmosphere | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"So these were the reasons why the atmosphere is so important, and why atmospheric pressure is highest at sea level, and decreases with increasing altitude."
130,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Who didn't love playing in a tub full of balls as a child? Now imagine a room that is full of these balls, and where they are constantly running in different directions. This is how gas molecules move. In this video we will learn more about amazing gases, and also the effect of temperature and pressure on them."
131,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Have you ever wondered why the cork pops out of a champagne bottle faster, or why foam and bubbles form when a cold drink bottle is shaken? It is related to the gas and the pressure inside the bottle. So let's look at pressure and gases in a little more detail."
132,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Gases exert pressure on the surface they are in contact with. The more the particles hit the wall of the vessel, the higher the pressure. For example, when you shake a bottle of cold drink, and bubbles form in it, it feels harder than before. It is a gas particle, which is pushing on a plastic bottle. We have this equation: The force per unit area is called pressure."
133,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"We also see the effect of pressure on gases, when we inflate a balloon too much, and it explodes. This happens because we have greatly increased the pressure of the air molecules pushing on the surface of the balloon."
134,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"The pressure also increases with the release of heat. Why does this happen? As a gas is heated, the energy of its particles increases, and they begin to accelerate. So they hit the walls of the vessel faster, and more often. This increases the pressure, and if the pressure increases too much, the vessel may even burst. Think of bursting balloons and tyres."
135,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Ever read the writing on your deodorant can - it warns not to keep it in the sun. This is because there is a gas inside the can, and we have seen that heating the gas increases the pressure, which can cause the can to burst. Therefore, it would not be right to do so."
136,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"So what if we cool the gas? In this case the energy of the particles will be less, and there will be less pressure on the walls of the vessel. Therefore the balloon will shrink and hang. Now let's talk about that, which none of us like."
137,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Needles and syringes. Thankfully no injections are going to happen today. We are knowing about them only to understand the pressure of gases. When the plunger of a syringe is pulled out, the volume of the chamber increases. As the volume increases, the pressure inside decreases."
138,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"Now we've created a vacuum that wants to get back to normal atmospheric pressure. Because, apart from the needle in your arm, it has no contact with the outside environment, therefore, the fluid that is available to pass in is your blood and is drawn into the chamber. Your blood reduces the empty volume, and the pressure returns to normal levels."
139,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,Pause the video and fill in the words in the blanks.
140,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,were your answers correct?
141,Pressure in Gases | Matter | Physics | FuseSchool,"So we have seen how volume, temperature and number of molecules affect the pressure of a gas. Hope you enjoyed today's lesson. See you next time."

143,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Hydrochloric acid is a chemical that has the ability to burn anything. It should not be touched without safety gloves and safety goggles. Despite this, this chemical is found inside our body. Stomach acid is, in fact, hydrochloric acid with a pH of about 1 to 2."
144,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","So let's know, what is the function of gastric acid in our body. Stomach acid performs two main functions. Since it is an acid with a low pH, it works to break down any protein present in our food into smaller parts. This means that it breaks apart the amino acid links that make up the complex structures of proteins."
145,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","If you want to know more about proteins and their composition, then definitely watch a video related to it on our channel."
146,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Gastric acid activates some important digestive enzymes, such as proteases and lipases. Meaning makes them worth doing their job. These enzymes are able to do their work only at low pH. Protease enzymes break down long chains of amino acids
Breaks them down into smaller pieces or the amino acid components that make them up."
147,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool",What do you think Lippez would be doing? Pause this video for a while and think about this question.
148,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Lipases break down lipids or fat molecules. But in the walls of our stomach, where does this acid come from? Why does a substance with such a low pH not damage the walls of the stomach? The answer lies in those cells that are found in the inner part of the stomach wall."
149,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","These cells produce mucus, which protects your stomach wall from this strong acid. But sometimes the amount of acid in the stomach becomes more, or sometimes it starts coming upwards into the esophagus. This abnormal condition is known as ""acid reflux""."
150,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","This happens when a large amount of food has been eaten in a short period of time. Or it could be due to eating food that has more spices, more oil, more chili, or food that is acidic or sour."
151,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","If this is happening due to the increased amount of acid in the stomach, then how do you think it can be neutralized? Pause this video here, think about this question, and start again when you get an answer."
152,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Eating something alkaline can help relieve the burning sensation. This is an example of the acid-base neutralization process of everyday life. Antacids can be a treatment for this, and it can be bought from any drug store or supermarket."
153,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","Depending on the brand, antacids may contain the following substances: calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate. Let's take the example of calcium carbonate."
154,"Stomach Acid | Acids, Bases & Alkali's | Chemistry | FuseSchool","As a result of this reaction, calcium chloride (salts), water and carbon dioxide gases are obtained. This can help relieve irritation caused by acid reflux."
